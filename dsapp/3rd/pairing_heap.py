The code in this file implements a pairing heap.  By default it
operates as a min-heap, but it can also work as a max-heap via a flag
passed to the heap's __init__ routing.

The important papers on pairing heaps are these:

Robert E. Tarjan.  The Pairing Heap: A New Form of Self-Adjusting
Heap.  Algorithmica 1:111-129, 1986.

experiments and analysis.  Communications of the ACM, Volume 30, Issue

related data structures.  Journal of the ACM, Volume 46, Issue 4,
Pages 473-501, 1999.

There are actually several varieties of pairing heaps.  Five are
described in [1], and two more are described in [2].  This
implementation is the basic pairing heaps described in [1], also known
as the twopass variant.  There isn't much published evidence that any
of the variants are significantly better than the others.

The twopass pairing heap works as follows.

A pairing heap is a tree that maintains the heap property: each node
has a lower value than all its children.  The pairing heap tree need
not be binary nor balanced.  The good amortized efficiency of the
pairing heap results from clever algorithms for .adjust_key() and
.delete().

The basic operation in the pairing heap is the comparison-link.  Two
nodes are compared, and the largest is linked as a child of the
smaller.  To represent the tree, each node maintains a pointer to the
leftmost child and to its right sibling.  Each node also maintains a
pointer to its parent.  When a comparison-link is performed, the new
child becomes the leftmost child.

[1] suggests a memory optimization where only the right-most sibling
stores a pointer to the parent, and each node maintains a single bit
indicating if it is that rightmost sibling.  This theoretically saves
the size of a pointer in each node, but only if we can store a bit for
free.  However, storing a bit takes just as much space as storing a
pointer, due to padding.  So, we bite the bullet and store the
pointer.  Also, [3] shows that the amortized cost of .adjust_key()
is at least Omega(log log n) if the parent pointer is *not* stored.
The amortized cost may be better using the parent pointer.

For .adjust_key(), the topmost element is removed and set aside as
the return value.  A left-to-right pass is made over its children,
comparison-linking them pairwise.  For example, if there are 6
children labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, A and B will be
comparison-linked, as will C and D, and E and F.  Next, the rightmost
node is repeatedly comparison-linked with its sibling until there is
only one node left.  This node is the new root.

For .delete(), first the node is cut from its parent.  This results in
a tree rooted at the node being deleted.  The .adjust_key()
procedure is invoked on the node, then the resulting tree is
comparison-linked with the original tree.

See [1] for more details.  It also includes figures which are helpful
for understanding.
